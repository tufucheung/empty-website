        <p>this is Empty.<br>
        a software studio that dreams of crafting software for those who truly love to think.<br>
        we believe in the power of simplicity, that less is more.<br>
        we believe that exceptional software is an integral part of a life well-lived.<br>
        we believe in the honesty of details.<br>
        we embrace innovative ideas and are willing to take risks to create works that stand alone.<br>
        we pursue lasting value, not ephemeral trends.<br>
        we remain humble, always learning.<br>
        we are the survivors of idealism.<br>
        we see the absurdity of the world,<br>
        yet we still understand the profound meaning of love.<br>
        this is Empty.</p>
