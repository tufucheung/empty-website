        <p>This is Empty.<br>
        A software studio that dreams of crafting software for those who truly love to THINK.<br>
        We believe in the power of simplicity, that less is more.<br>
        We believe that exceptional software is an integral part of a life well-lived.<br>
        We believe in the honesty of details.<br>
        We embrace innovative ideas and are willing to take risks to create works that stand alone.<br>
        We pursue lasting value, not ephemeral trends.<br>
        We remain humble, always learning.<br>
        We are the survivors of idealism.<br>
        We see the absurdity of the world,<br>
        yet we still understand the profound meaning of love.<br>
        This is Empty.</p>
